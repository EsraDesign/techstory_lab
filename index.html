            In the Tech & Story Lab you can experiment with new technology and
            learn to work with different equipment on your own. We have
            everything from cameras, microphones and lighting equipment to VR
            gear, AI technologies, RaspberryPi's and much more. You can borrow a
            large selection of equipment and get expert guidance in using it.

          <p>
            To borrow equipment and use our facilities, remember to bring your
            student card.
          </p>
          <p>
            The student card must be valid and may only be used by the card
            owner.

          You are always welcome to drop by us if you are looking for special
          equipment for your project or need advice and guidance.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you already know in advance which equipment you need, you can see
          if the equipment is available in the booking module. Please note,
          however, that the booking module is indicative - we cannot therefore
          guarantee that all equipment is available.
        </p>
        <p>
          To book and have equipment delivered, visit us in the Tech & Story
          Lab.
